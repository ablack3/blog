      <description>Often the data we work with health services research fits the definition of event sourced data. In software development Event Sourcing has a specific meaning that I am not qualified to explain precisely. Basically any changes to a system are captured as event records. When changes happen they are recorded as event records and the current state of the system at any point in time can be constructed by aggregating all of the event records.</description>
