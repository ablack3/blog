Anytime I come across the cliche "Only a poor crafts-person blames the tool" I cringe a little bit. I understand the sentiment. It is easy to blame failures on tools and the pros seem to be able to make magic happen with whatever they have available. However the truth is that tools really do make an enormous difference and anyone working at a high level has learned how to use a set of tools effectively.

At one of my early jobs I worked at a very small family owned manufacturing business. Part of my job was to cut aluminum bars to specific lengths. I used a miter saw fit with a blade designed for cutting wood! Making cuts was terrifying. Every so often the blade would catch one of the bars and send it flying. Initially I would just hold my breath and make the cut hoping that that this time things would work out OK. Eventually I got better at using the wood blade to cut the aluminum bars but the chance of a mishap was always quite high.

I knew that the tool I was given to do my job was terrible but, being inexperienced, I didn't have any idea what the ideal would be. It only dawned on me years later how bad the tool really was. Was it possible to use a wood blade to cut aluminum? Yes! Could a person even get pretty good doing that? Yes! But the risk of mistake and injury was much higher than it needed to be. Some very smart engineers  designed that blade to cut wood. Why in the world would anyone use it to cut metal?

Tools are designed to solve specific problems and good craftspeople are particular about their tools. In some ways the process of becoming an expert is about discovering the right tools for your task and learning to use them. Often the best tools are not the expensive or fancy. Contrary to the cliche, tools matter and no one aspiring to master their craft should be chastised for wanting good tools.
